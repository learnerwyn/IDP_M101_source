Integrated Design Project (Team M101)

In the integrated design project (IDP) students work in teams of 6/7 to develop an autonomous robotic system to solve a problem inspired by a real-world challenge. Teams develop hardware, electronics, sensing and the accompanying control and software systems. At the end of the project there is a competition to assess the robot's performance

Scenario

A team from the University of Cambridge storage facility are investigating the possibility of automating package
storage and dispatch operations. Part of the automation requires the use of an using automated guided vehicle (AGV)
to convey packages to and from locations within their four warehouses. As a part of their engineering team, you are
tasked with designing an AGV prototype that can pick up packages and deliver them to designated locations, in good
conditions, and safely. Feasibility tests are currently being conducting, and you are tasked with constructing an AGV
fulfilling the following criteria:

- It must be safe both around humans and hardware
- It must clearly display an amber/orange light when in operation.
- It must be able to automatically recognise packages via a QR code for a storage location or delivery bay
- The four sites are the same but not identical; the AGV must be able to deal with minor differences, changes in surface conditions and navigation lines, at all sites.
Furthermore:

- During transportation packages must not be more than 20mm from the ground
- Packages must be handed respectfully without damage, and cannot be rotated upside down
- Packages are individually identified with a QR code which identifies a specific storage location

IMPORTANT NOTE

The University has an exceptional Health and Safety (H&S) record, and any breaches will be recorded. As an
engineer, you are personally responsible for yourself, the people around you and the project. The selection of your
team’s AGV by the company will depend on how you fare on these 5 categories:
1. Health and Safety: the team and AGV always operate within all required health and safety arrangements for the
duration of the task a standard industry requirement. Minor breaches will be recorded, and major breaches can lead
to exclusion from the competition.
2. Accuracy: the ability of the AGV to correctly make its way to the package pickup points, to collect packages, and
accurately deliver them.
3. Efficiency: the AGV are required to pick-up and deliver as many packages as possible, within 5 minutes.
4. Sustainability: the AGV are to be designed with minimal parts to keep cost and carbon footprint low.
5. Reproducibility: the AGV documentation should be provided such that the design is reproducible by engineers, in
large volumes.

Competition

IDP teams will be given 5 minutes to complete this challenge: once the timer has started it will not be reset, you can
restart as many times as you like and the run with the highest score will count.
Collect a package from one of the loading/unloading bays and deliver to the storage location specified in the QR
code affixed to the package.
Initially 4 packages will be placed randomly one on each loading/unloading bay.
There will be one package for each storage location.
If teams manage to deliver all the packages within the 5 minutes additional packages will be placed, one at a time, in
a random loading/unloading bays.
If an AGV collides with any part of the table furniture it will be deemed as defective, it will be removed from the
table, reset, and started again - note that the timer will not stop.
AGVs will start in the start box, AGVs must fit in its entirety (on the line is acceptable), and additional marks will be
added for AGVs that successfully delivers at least 2 packages, returns to the start box and parks within it.
